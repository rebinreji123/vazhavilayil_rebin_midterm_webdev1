# Midterm Project - Responsive Boxed Web Layout

## Student: Rebin Reji Vazhavilayil

### Project Description:
This project aims to demonstrate my ability to create wireframes and translate them into responsive boxed web layouts. The wireframes and layouts will be designed for a website of my own creation, distinct from my FIP project. The primary focus will be on creating a responsive grid layout for a single page (index.html).

### Midterm Deliverables:
1. **Step 1: Wireframes for 2 HTML pages**
   - Submission of Work-in-Progress (WIP) wireframes in PDF format (5% of grade)

2. **Step 2: Boxed Responsive Layout for 1 Page (index.html)**
   - Completion of wireframes from Step 1
   - Creation of a boxed-out HTML page with responsive layout
   
### Project Timeline:
- **Week 1:**
  - Design wireframes for 2 HTML pages
  - Submit WIP wireframes for feedback

- **Week 2:**
  - Finalize wireframes based on feedback
  - Implement boxed responsive layout for index.html

### Note:
- The boxed layout created for this midterm can be utilized for the FIP project if preferred, or a new boxed layout can be designed.
- Each student is expected to complete the midterm steps individually.
  
### Resources:
- Utilize design principles and responsive grid systems learned in class.
- Seek feedback from peers and instructors during the development process.

### Submission Guidelines:
